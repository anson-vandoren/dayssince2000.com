This is the repo containing the code for the simple [Days Since 2000](https://dayssince2000.com) website.

# What is this site?

I work on the software team of a capital equipment company that sells factory-sized inkjet printers to OLED and QDCF display manufacturers. Our build pipeline creates version numbers using MSBuild's "build number" and "build revision" parameters. I frequently need to track down when that software was built in order to determine from which point in history the code came.

After about the 10th time of asking Google "how many days since 01-01-2000" and doing calculator math to turn a revision number into a timestamp, I decided it would be quicker to just code it up once and build a nice simple site to get exactly what I want.

# Why the domain name?

I bought the domain name when we hadn't fully decided on how we were going to version our builds, and at the time it looked like we were just going to use the "build number" (which is MSBuild code for the number of days since January 1st, 2000).

Also, a domain of "whyCantWeUseIntuitiveVersioning.com" was already taken. Or maybe it wasn't - I didn't actually check.

# Are you really that bored?

No, not particularly. In fact, I have a ton of other projects that I'd rather be working on instead of writing this damn about page right now.

But, I am lazy. The kind of lazy that would rather spend an hour or two now to save a few minutes each week for however long I end up caring about this sort of version number. Hopefully that second part adds up to more than the first part...
